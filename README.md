# What is this?
Hi. Those are my old Paint.NET plugins, which usually render some kind of a pattern.  
They were written for old Paint.NET versions, so they dont't work now.  
I am planning to update them.

So what do they do?

## Paint.XOR
What happens, if you XOR an X and Y coordinates?  
You'll get a number.  
If you filter out the numbers, that are not primes, an interesting pattern emerges.

An important note:  
My examples are not "pure", meaning that the pictures are not raw outputs of the plugin, but a result of an artistic process applied to the raw images.  
But you can get the idea, the pattern is recognizeable across all of the pictures.

## Paint.RND
Just a configurable random noise generator.
### Example output:

## Paint.ECA
Elementary Cellular Automaton implementation as a Paint.NET plugin.

## Basket
That one is somewhat recent.  
I didn't enforce my own naming convention, cause I didn't care.

### Example output:
![To be provided (when I fix my plugins)]()

---------------------------------------

## Paint.GEN
Although I have made some interesting images with it, this plugin is in unusable state, which is why it's source code is not included.

### How it works:
Basically, it randomly stacks up mathematical functions on the X and/or Y coordinate(-s) of the image.  
Due to the nature of mathematics, a limiting function had to be implemented, which I did a terrible job at doing.
